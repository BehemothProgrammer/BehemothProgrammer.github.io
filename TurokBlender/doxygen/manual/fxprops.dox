Credit to Smoke39 (https://smoke39.github.io/turok/fx.html) for the comments on some of these after rotationOffset. There's too many properties to explain!

bFadeout                    // Not used
bStopAnimOnImpact           // if impacts a floor and onCollideFloor is Bounce or Reflect then stops animating the sprite
bOffsetFromFloor            // sprite z position += (textureAtlasHeight - (GAME_SCALE * 0.4f)) * drawScale
bTextureWrapMirrorWidth     // Mirrors sprite horizontally and vertically
bTextureWrapMirrorHeight    // Not used
bDepthBuffer                // if set will draw behind objects otherwise will draw in front
bActorInstance              // Not used
bScaleLerp                  // if is 0 will multiply scale by scaleDest otherwise will add scaleDest
bLensFlares                 // Enable Lens Flare effect.
lensFlares                  // Path to the lens flare. lensFlares = "lensflares/sunflare.klf"
bBlood                      // Blood effects won't spawn if the menu option is set to no blood or actor has the no blood flag set.
bAddOffset                  // The velocity passed into SpawnFx will be added to the initial velocity of this Fx. kActor::SpawnProjectile, kActor::FireProjectile, all Game.SpawnFx except the one that has a velocity param, and kexEmitter's use no velocity. kActor::SpawnFx will use the actors Movement() as the velocity.
bNoDirection                // Uses no rotation (World forward direction) for translation and offset (including random variants)
bFlash                      // Changes the sunDirection based on the Fx Origin. Adds white color to the sunLightColor and black color to the sunAmbientColor. (only the last Fx that was created with this property will take effect)
bProjectile                 // If this Fx has an owner actor then rotation is set towards the owners target. Also allows more than 200 instances.
bDestroyOnWaterSurface      // Removes this Fx when it enters or exits the areas water height. If this Fx is a bBullet then will only remove it when velocity.z is less than 0.
bStickOnTarget              // if collides with an actor then it's position is set to the actors position + half the height of the actor.
bBullet                     // bounces off collided walls/floors if onCollideWall/onCollideFloor is Bounce or Reflect. Also allows more than 200 instances.
bWeaponView                 // Draws in the camera view
bFullScreen                 // Draws to the center of the camera view and forward by GAME_SCALE * 20.
bDecalOffset                // if drawType is a decal(2) and onCollideWall is not default(0) then the z position will never be lower than floorheight + (GAME_SCALE * 0.1f) otherwise the z position will never be lower than floorheight + 3.413333333333334f. bOffsetFromFloor can still further affect the z position offset after this.
bNoSpawnNear                // Will not spawn the effect if the squared distance to the camera view is <= (GAME_SCALE * 20) * (GAME_SCALE * 20). You can use noSpawnNearFarDist to set the distance.
bNoSpawnFar                 // Will not spawn the effect if the squared distance to the camera view is >= (GAME_SCALE * 20) * (GAME_SCALE * 20). You can use noSpawnNearFarDist to set the distance.
noSpawnNearFarDist          // Set a custom squared distance to be used for bNoSpawnNear or bNoSpawnFar
bAttachSource               // Sets to this Fx's owner position
bAttachSourceAnimOffset     // if bAttachSource is set then this will add the actors AnimState baseOffset to origin.z
bDrawOnBottom               // Will draw the Fx last
bSparkle                    // Not used

bImpactEffect               // Not used
bRestrictAim                // if Fx is a bProjectile then will RestrictAim towards the target by 90 degrees yaw. and will move forward if not in that fov.
bNoWallSpawn                // if onCollideWall is Destroy(1) then won't spawn impact fx. Bullets won't spawn impact fx and could bounce forever.
bNoGroundSpawn              // if onCollideFloor is Destroy(1) then won't spawn impact fx. if onCollideFloor is Bounce(3) or Reflect(2) and Fx is a bullet then won't spawn impact fx and could bounce forever.
bRetainVelocity             // Not used
bNoHitSource                // Not used
bPerPolyCollision           // Enables poly collision checks on static meshes if the menu option precise is on.
bDrawDelay                  // Don't draw the Fx until it has ticked once

waterFriction               // if in water then velocity xy is multiplied by this value. (real waterFriction value is (1.0f - this value)). Afterwards if the Fx z velocity is < 0 then the z velocity is multiplied by 0.905f
animFriction                // if is not 0.0 and animtype != 6(DrawSingleFrame) then:

-----Event Blocks:
onImpact                    // The 10 OnImpact events with each surface type you can have.
onExpire                    // happens when lifeTime runs out, unless underwater
onTick                      // happens continuously, unless underwater
onWaterImpact               // happens when entering or exiting water. If this Fx is a bBullet then will only be called if velocity.z is less than 0.
onWaterExpire               // happens instead of onExpire when lifeTime runs out, if underwater
onWaterTick                 // happens continuously instead of onTick while underwater

-----Inside event blocks you can define:
fx                          // spawn another effect. fx = "fx/blood.kfx"
sound                       // play a sound. sound = "sounds/shaders/bullet_impact_13.ksnd"
damageClass                 // deal damage, from defs/damageInfo.txt. damageClass = "S_Damage_Target_damage_10". ignored by onWaterImpact.
