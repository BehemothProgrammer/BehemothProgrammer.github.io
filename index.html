	<p>I'm sure everyone who enjoys making custom models and animation mods would really like this. Just keep in mind these were only for me, but I'm giving them to everyone anyway so they're not fancy. If you're new to Unity and need to know how to use it then watching videos of getting started with Unity would be what you need. Unity Personal Edition (<a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download</a>) is free to download and you can use that to use these scripts.</p>

	<p>You will need basic knowledge of how to navigate Unity (There's plenty of Tutorials online for getting started). And if you're interested in making animations you'll need to know how to create AnimationClips. And I'll explain how to use the scripts I made in Unity.</p>
